### From learning to doing
It's my first blog post, and in fact, my first contribution to my personal website and I find myself grasping for first words. 
I've spent an exorbitant amount of time learning different programming languages, concepts of Computer Science, and at the drawing board coming up with fun projects.
When it suddenly occurs to me as I start my job hunt that I need to put them on display. 
### Selecting a Static Site Generator
The first decision I have to make is selecting a [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/). After some surfing, and a recommendation from a [friend](https://tuckersiemens.com/) I opt for [Hexo.io](https://hexo.io/).

### Selecting a web host
