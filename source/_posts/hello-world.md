### From learning to doing
It's my first blog post, in fact, my first contribution to my personal website and I find myself grasping for first words.  I've spent an exorbitant amount of time learning different programming languages, concepts of Computer Science, and at the drawing board coming up with fun projects.  When it suddenly occurs to me as I start my job hunt that I need to put them on display.  So, what better way then to start my personal blog, website, and host my projects all in the same place?

### Sharing secrets, with friends and strangers alike
During my time tutoring and being a teaching assistant I learned that more often than not a beginner would lack the ability to ask the right question. More often than not it related specifically to vocabulary. This notion that perhaps teaching students vocabulary seemed condescending to me, the last time someone taught me vocabulary I must have been shy of nine or so, then of course there was studying for the SAT which was exclusively self-taught. So then why is it as an adult I find myself teaching beginners of Computer Science more vocabulary than anything else? I thought perhaps I was off my rocker, [thankfully](http://nyti.ms/1FJ9WSh) a friend of mine recently mentioned a BBC documentary discussing the relationship between language and our ability to see. Further research on this particular documentary and discussion are shelved for now. It does however add to my belief that there is reason to believe that in teaching we must consider that students need help learning vocabulary for it introduces them to things they did not previously know existed. 

One of the challenges I find myself facing over and over again is knowing where to start on a project.  
### Selecting a web host

### Selecting a Static Site Generator
Being that I have experience in manually building webpages via HTML and CSS I think it's time for me to reduce the amount of time I spend handwriting my pages.
This is where the static site generators come into play. For blogging purposes I still write markdown, but I don't have to encode all my HTML manually.
I have to select a [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/). After some surfing, and a recommendation from a [friend](https://tuckersiemens.com/) I opt for [Hexo.io](https://hexo.io/).
